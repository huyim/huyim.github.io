$ ./ORIGIN_OF_EVERYTHING

Before I chose the path of a computer science major, I thought programming was a boring thing.
In my mind, programmers always sat in front of a screen and were isolated from our beautiful
natural world. Things changed after I wrote down my first few lines of Python code and first
program:

> Print(“Hello World!”)
> Hello World!

Indeed, it really opened a new world for me. I gradually learned how to get input from users,
write loops, and use control statements. At the end of that quarter, I was able to create a small
“tic tac toe” game. If a programmer had enough imaginations, he or she could build a “world”
with kinds of programs, and this virtual world was just as fun as our natural world. One story that
inspired me was that a person wrote a chatbot to chat with himself, and this chatbot could even
do the translation between different languages. Suddenly, I felt learning to program was a good
starting point to help me be more creative: games, useful software or simulate hard math
problems. I decided to enter this new computer world, and full of interesting things were just
waiting for me.

$ ./0_AND_1

The computer can be one of the most sophisticated and advanced products in human history.
How does it work? This was also my first question while I entered this major. Everything seems
dependent on a small chip on my computer, and it was so incredible. Computer architecture and
machine-dependent language were two classes that solved my question. The binary system, 0
and 1, is the language that our computer hardware can understand. Different parts of the CPU
were in charge of different instructions. It was easy to get a basic understanding of how a
computer works, but I started felt lost after digging more. Some fancy terms like parallelism and
virtual memory were obstacles on my path of computer literacy. The more I learned about the
hardware, the more complex and incredible I felt about the computer. A good thing was that I
knew the hardware was not my specialty and I should pursue more on the software part. After I
had a basic understanding of the mechanism of the computer, I headed to algorithms.

$ ./RECURSION_AND_MATRYOSHKA_DOLL

One of my professors told me that recursion was the heart of algorithms and the most beautiful
part of the programming. To be honest, the first feeling that recursion
gave me was the Matryoshka doll, which was also called the nesting
doll and originally from Russia. Learning recursion was a difficult
mission for me. I used to think linearly like one function after another,
but recursion algorithms wanted me to think one function nesting
another (shown on the figure). A joke, which appeared on many
websites and books, stated “one must understand recursion to
understand recursion” and captured my feelings accurately. I felt my brain was burning and
swelling whenever I tried to learn and write recursion algorithms. However, On many occasions,
recursion algorithms are more efficient and they are easier to solve a problem. After a long time
of training, I will think if a problem can be solved by recursion first now. At some moments, I am
surprised that I do not think linearly first and I will ask myself:
“Am I a computer now?”
“Am I a robot now?”

$ ./HOT_TOPIC

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are really hot topics in today’s world. As I am writing
this essay now, Google docs are trying to make predictions (shown on the figure) on what words
I will write next and save my typing time. I cannot miss
them on building my computer literacy. I started to
learn some AI algorithms and the logic behind them.
However, I always have a mixed feeling about the
current AI studies while studying. Good thing is that
they help a lot in assisting our life. I just mention how it
assists me in writing this essay. Downsides of AI
development could be a potential violation of our
privacy. The current algorithms I learned require big
data to feed them to be “smart”, and much data come
from users. The learning of artificial intelligence and machine learning make me think about the
social effects of technology. These new technologies serve the general public after all, and I
start to care about the potential negative effects of them.

$ ./WRITING_AS_A_PROGRAMMER

If you talk to programmers about their favorite languages, they probably answer you Python,
Java, or C++. Python is my favorite language, and writing Python code is no different from
writing an English essay. However, actual English writing, which is the traditional sense of
writing, is still important to programmers. README is a file that programmers describe the
usage, purpose, logic, and design of a program. It is just like a user manual. Good programmers
should not just be good at programming, and they also have to master writing skills . These skills
help them to better introduce their programs to other people, Thus, writing is also part of my
computer literacy. I have to use plain text to “translate” my thinking to exact words. Sometimes I
only have an abstract idea about my program, that is, I know how it works but feel hard to
translate it into readable paragraphs. It sounds weird but happens to me a lot of times. It is even
harder while I have to describe some academic definitions into a language that most people can
understand. Nevertheless, I am still in the process of learning writing and making my README
more understandable.

$ ./NEW_THINKING

After stepping into my third year as a computer science major, website design
captured my eyes. For a long time, I was just typing code in a terminal and
interacting with the computer. It seems that I always had a long-distance from
users, and users cannot feel my work directly. However, website design, or
frontend more precisely, gave me a chance to interact with users without
distance. The way I designed my website can be seen directly by my users. I also
had a feeling that I left a black and white world displayed by the terminal and
entered a colorful world with HTML , CSS , and JavaScript . Design is a completely
new world for me. Unlike my previous programs with README, it would be a failure
that users need a README to know how to use my website. During quarantine times,
I tried to design a website about sharing songs with friends. I asked my parents
how they feel about that, and they just simply answered that it was hard to use…
So, new challenges that just come to me, and I am considering going deep on that
by reading books or even pursuing graduate school in related fields. On the path
of computer literacy, I always find new and fun things.
